## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT open a GitHub Issue for a security vulnerability.**

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it immediately via the following channels:

1. **Email**: security@un.org
2. **Project Sponsor**: Contact the UN OICT project lead directly.

Please include as much detail as possible, including:
- Type of vulnerability.
- Potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce (if safe).

We take security seriously and will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.

## Security Design Principles
- **Data Sovereignty**: Per-agency data partitioning.
- **Auditability**: Tamper-evident logging of all operations.
- **Zero Trust**: Authentication and authorization enforced at every layer.
